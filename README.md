# Scalable-Analysis-of-NYC-Taxi-Trips-Using-PySpark
This project demonstrates the use of PySpark to process and analyze a large-scale dataset of synthetic NYC taxi trip data. The repository includes a complete pipeline for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the data to derive meaningful insights.

#### Key Features:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values to ensure data integrity.
- **Scalable Transformations**: Efficiently computing trip durations and other metrics using distributed processing.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: 
  - Identifying the top pickup locations by trip count.
  - Calculating average trip duration and analyzing trip patterns.
- **Visualization**: Generating bar charts to visualize key insights such as top pickup locations.
- **Exporting Results**: Saving processed data and visualizations for further analysis.

#### Deliverables:
1. Transformed dataset exported as a CSV file.
2. Visualizations saved as images.
3. Insights into trip patterns, duration, and location trends.

This project highlights the scalability of PySpark for big data analysis while integrating Python libraries for visualization and results sharing.
